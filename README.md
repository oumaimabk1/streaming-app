# Streamy

## What is Streamy?

Ever thought you paid too much for subscriptions to several streaming platforms? And barely could find something half decent? Yeah, so did we. Our friend Kevin even had to choose between paying his rent and paying for streaming services. That's where  Streamy comes in! We didn't want to have to sell our liver to afford a subscription to everything. So we made streamy, containing all the movies that came out. I know what you're thinking: "he must mean they just have a lot of movies". But no, we have ALL the movies.

## How did we do it?

With a clever combination of:

    •   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
    •   [React](https://reactjs.org)
    •   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
    •   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    •   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
    •   [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

We had Nico as a front-end developer, and Oumaima and Zineb as back-end developers.
