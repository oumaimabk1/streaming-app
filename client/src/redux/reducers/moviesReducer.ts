// Step 2: Define a reducer that will update the store with the movie response


interface movieState {
    movieData: any;
  }
  
  const initialState: movieState = {
    movieData: null,
  };
  
export const movieReducer = (state = initialState, action: any) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'MOVIE_DATA_RECEIVED':
        return { ...state, movieData: action.payload };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };
